The analysis of the COMPAS Recidivism Dataset using IBM's AI Fairness 360 toolkit revealed significant racial bias in the risk scores assigned to individuals. The logistic regression model trained on the dataset indicated a disparity in false positive rates between African-American and Caucasian individuals. Specifically, the false positive rate for African-American individuals was notably higher than that for their Caucasian counterparts, suggesting that the model is more likely to incorrectly classify African-American individuals as high-risk for recidivism.

To address this bias, several remediation steps are recommended. First, implementing reweighing techniques can help adjust the training data to ensure that both racial groups are equally represented in the risk assessment process. This can mitigate the impact of historical biases present in the dataset. Second, regular audits of the model's performance should be conducted to monitor for any emerging biases and ensure compliance with fairness standards. Lastly, incorporating fairness constraints during model training can help create a more equitable risk assessment tool.

In conclusion, while the COMPAS Recidivism Dataset provides valuable insights into recidivism risk, it is crucial to address the identified biases to promote fairness and equity in the criminal justice system. By employing the recommended remediation strategies, stakeholders can work towards developing a more just and reliable risk assessment framework.
